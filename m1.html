    <h2>Preventive Maintenance</h2>
    <p>
        Preventive maintenance seeks out and repairs more minor issues and decreases the occurrence of major repairs. This type may take on aspects of all other maintenance types. For example, maintenance inspections may change based on the age of the equipment. When it is new, the procedure may be more of a predetermined maintenance style, but as it ages, more frequent inspections, both physical and through data, may prevent minor performance issues from becoming extensive and more costly repairs.
    </p>
    <h2>Example</h2>
    <p>
        An excellent example of preventative maintenance is the seasonal cleaning of an HVAC unit. In spring, you schedule maintenance to ensure that grit and sand are not inside the casing or leaves are not blocking the air intake. There is no specific issue, but we know that leaves can accumulate throughout the seasons and cause problems later in the year. Removing the grit or leaves prevents a later difficulty, such as poor performance, increased energy usage, etc.
