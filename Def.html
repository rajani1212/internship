    <p style="font-size:20px;line-height: 35px;">Product engineering is the process of turning an idea into a fully manufacturable product. The process is normally split into different phases with different project team members working on specific aspects of the product development. The hardware design would typically be completed by CAD development engineers, whereas the software would be completed by software engineers.</p>

    <p style="font-size:20px;line-height: 35px;">Product Engineering is the process of innovating, designing, developing, testing and deploying a software product. The advent of Web 2.0 technologies and utility based software delivery through Software as a Service (SaaS).</p>
<p style="font-size:20px;line-height: 35px;">Software as a Service (SaaS) has led to the process of gradual transformation of client enabling engineering services from traditional software engineering to product engineering. </p><p style="font-size:20px;line-height: 35px;">Product engineering is creating and seeing a product through its entire life cycle from conception to end-of-life.Product engineering involves overseeing many aspects of the product, including its quality, cost, performance, usability, reliability, lifespan, and serviceability. Without product engineering, a product would remain an idea, so it plays a crucial role in developing a product. 
    </p><p style="font-size:20px;line-height: 35px;">The industry of product engineering is on the rise. According to Allied Market Research, the global product engineering services market size was valued at $1085.8 billion in 2021 and is projected to reach $1610.6 billion by 2031.</p>
    <h3 style="font-weight:bold">Understand this way</h3>
    <p style="font-size:20px;line-height: 35px;">Product engineering is like building a puzzle. Imagine you have all these different pieces - ideas, designs, technology, and materials. 
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:20px;line-height: 35px;">Product engineering is about putting these pieces together in just the right way to create something awesome - a product that works well, looks good, and solves a problem for people.
