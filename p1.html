    <h1>A brief history of platform engineering</h1>
        <p>
            Software development lifecycles are accelerating as organizations push to gain market share, build competitive advantage, and drive innovation. Shorter development cycles mean more time and resources spent on the underlying toolchains needed for new software iterations. At the same time, development and deployment environments have become considerably more complex with factors such as security, data protection, regulatory considerations and varying cloud alternatives.
        </p>
        <p>
            These toolchains have long been the direct responsibility of developers and project teams. Developers select, deploy, manage and maintain the tools, and then rely on separate operations staff to provision and configure the resources needed to deploy each build for testing and production.
        </p>
        <p>
            This paradigm offers flexibility, but it also leads to inconsistencies, bottlenecks and waste. A development team that can barely keep pace with accelerating release schedules might struggle to maintain the supporting toolchain. Setting up tools and troubleshooting their issues takes time away from development. Each project team could adopt different tools and workflows, and development and operations pose challenging silos that are difficult to blend.
        </p>
        <p>
            Rising platform complexity and the issues that come with it have led to platform engineering. Instead of leaving developers to the task, platform engineering provides a specialized role to manage the underlying platform of development tools, services and environments.
