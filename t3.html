    <h2>Market Testing</h2>
    <p> Market testing involves introducing a product or service to a limited group of potential customers before a full-scale launch. It's like a test run with a real audience to gather valuable feedback and identify any potential issues before a wider release.</p>
    <p>Here's the process:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A small, targeted group of potential customers is identified.</li>
        <li>The product or service is presented to this group, and they are encouraged to try it out.</li>
        <li>Feedback mechanisms like surveys, interviews, and focus groups are used to gather insights from the test audience.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Feedback mechanisms like surveys, interviews, and focus groups are used to gather insights from the test audience.</p>
    <h3>Example:</h3>
    <p>A company develops a new smart speaker. They conduct market testing by offering the device to a group of tech enthusiasts and early adopters. The user feedback might reveal that the voice recognition needs improvement, or the speaker lacks a specific feature desired by the target audience. This feedback allows the company to refine the product before its official release.
