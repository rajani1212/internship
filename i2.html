    <h1> Mind Mapping </h1>
    <p>A mind map is a graphical representation utilized to visually organize information. The process of mind mapping involves penning a central theme and coming up with new and associated ideas that branch out from the central idea.</p>

     <p>The central single idea is frequently in the format of an image drawn in the middle of a blank landscape page to which connected representations of ideas such as words, images, facts, figures, concepts or parts of words are added as they are thought up. Mind mapping utilizes the concept of “radiant thinking.” This means thoughts radiate (branch out) in different directions from a single idea. The branches may move forwards and backwards to and from the main (central) idea. This is in contrast to “linear thinking” which is a thought process following a step-by-step flow or known cycles where it is necessary to get the response to one step before moving to the next step.</p>
