    <h1>Platform engineer job responsibilities and skills</h1>
            <p>
                Platform engineers are responsible for handling all platform tasks, but specific responsibilities vary with the unique needs and size of each business. Common platform engineering responsibilities include the following:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Design, implement and maintain the platform. Platform engineers are infrastructure experts, and their principal role is to provide the tools, services and physical infrastructure developers use. This often extends to creating workflows and policies needed to facilitate the platform and its use.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Update and upgrade the platform. Platform engineers must evaluate and test new tools, and update existing tools as new patches and upgrades become available. They also document the platform and provide training to developers and other stakeholders.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Monitor infrastructure. The platform must meet clear and well-defined metrics for performance and availability. Platform engineers use tools and technologies to monitor the many elements of the platform to check health, ensure performance and maintain security.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Support platform and applications. Platform engineers are the helpdesk for the platform. Developers and other users will turn to platform engineers when they have problems with tools, services and application deployments. In turn, platform engineers perform troubleshooting and remediation of the platform and applications running on the platform.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Implement self-service and automation. Modern software development platforms often utilize (or are closely modeled after) the public cloud, with a strong emphasis on automation and self-service. Platform engineers develop scripts, APIs and other resources to automate the platform for developers.
                </li>
            </ul>
    
       
        <p>
            Platform engineers must also keep up with new technologies to ensure the platform is competitive. This often involves finding new opportunities to reduce costs and improve application performance and availability. In addition, platform engineers are excellent communicators who can work closely with platform stakeholders to discuss issues and develop a meaningful roadmap for platform development.</p>
