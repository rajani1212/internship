            <h1>Platform Engineering</h1>
            <p>
                Platform engineering is a specialized discipline within software development that focuses on designing, building, maintaining and improving the toolchains and workflows software developers use. Platform engineering provides comprehensive and consistent tools and processes, which enables developers to focus on software development instead of managing underlying toolchains.

            <p>
                A platform engineering team can build a common suite of tools, services and workflows that provides all development teams with an internal developer platform to streamline development, eliminate waste and enhance efficiency.
