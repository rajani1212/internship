    <h2>Predetermined Maintenance</h2>
    <p>
        Predetermined maintenance follows a plan of action created by the manufacture of equipment, rather than scheduled maintenance laid out by a maintenance team.
    </p>
    <h2>Example</h2>
    <p>
        An excellent example of predetermined maintenance is when machinery maintenance is scheduled at time intervals based on the manufactureâ€™s recommendations. For example, oil changes will be every fourth month. Transmission service will occur at X number of hours of run time. After one year of use, Parts X, Y, and Z are checked for wear. Engine replacement occurs after X number of years.

    <p>
        Even if the machine has sat idle for four months, the oil is changed. The list of maintenance is scheduled based on time or usage rather than functionality. Another example is when smart data indicates a decrease in productivity. The drop in performance signals a need for maintenance. Predetermined maintenance crosses over into predictive maintenance, where data reporting for issues occurs.
