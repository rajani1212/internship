    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>What is product engineering?</li>
        <p>Product engineering is the process of bringing a physical product from concept to creation. It involves activities like design, development, testing, manufacturing, and ensuring the product meets customer needs.</p>
        <li>What are the different stages of product engineering?</li>
        <p>The product engineering lifecycle typically involves stages like ideation, design, prototyping, testing, manufacturing, and launch.</p>
        <li>	What skills are required to be a product engineer?</li>
        <p>Product engineers need strong technical skills in areas like CAD, mechanical engineering, and materials science. Additionally, they should possess excellent communication, problem-solving, and analytical skills.</p>
        <li>	What career paths are available in product engineering?</li>
        <p>Product engineers can pursue careers in various industries, including consumer electronics, automotive, aerospace, and medical devices. They can specialize in areas like design engineering, manufacturing engineering, or quality control.</p>
        <li>	What is platform engineering?</li>
        <p>Platform engineering is the discipline focused on designing, building, and maintaining internal developer platforms (IDPs). These platforms empower developers to be more productive and self-sufficient by providing tools, services, and infrastructure.</p>
        <li>	What skills are required to be a platform engineer?</li>
        <p>Platform engineers need expertise in areas like cloud computing, DevOps, automation, and experience with various development tools and frameworks.</p>
        <li>	What's the difference between product engineering and platform engineering?</li>
        <p>Product engineering focuses on building physical products, while platform engineering focuses on building internal platforms used by developers to create software products.</p>
        <li>	What are the latest trends in product/platform engineering?</li>
        <p>Some trends include the growing adoption of cloud-based solutions, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in product development, and the increasing importance of user experience (UX) design.</p>
