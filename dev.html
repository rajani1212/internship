    <h1>what is product design</h1>
    <p>
        Product design is a cross-functional discipline that spans research, strategy, design, and business—with lots of collaboration along the way.
    </p>
    <p>
        The goal of product design is to ideate, design, and iterate on products that meet a specific user need, make sense from a business perspective, and compete successfully in their given market.
        
        It’s a multifaceted field, touching on UX and UI design, engineering, product management, and more

    <h2>7 fundamental elements and principles of product design </h2>
    <p>
        Product design is all about creating products that meet the end users’ needs, are competitive in their market, and help to achieve business goals. 
    </p>
    <p>
        To ensure success in all three areas, product design must consider seven key elements:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Desirability</li>
        <li>Feasibility</li>
        <li>Viability</li>
        <li>Functionality</li>
        <li>Aesthetics</li>
        <li>Quality</li>
        <li>User experience (UX)</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>What is product development?</h1>
    <p>Product development is the creation and launch of products to meet customer needs. The product development process includes stages such as ideation, marketing strategy and commercialization. It’s used for new product development (NPD) and the improvement of existing products.

    <h2>What are the stages of product development?</h2>
    <h3> Ideation</h3>
    <p>The conceptualization of ways to improve existing products or create new ones to meet customer needs happens during the ideation, or idea generation, stage. Teams can use different techniques for coming up with product ideas, such as brainstorming and storyboarding.</p> 
    <p>Ideation is often considered the first stage of product development, although some companies consider the first stage to be defining goals for the product. The early stages of product development may be referred to as the "fuzzy front end" or FFE because of their typically unstructured nature. </p>
    <h3> Idea screening</h3>   
    <p> Not all new product ideas that surface during the early stages of product development are viable. Idea screening can provide important validation for a product idea. Teams can conduct market research to evaluate a product idea, determining, for instance, whether it meets a market need and would appeal to potential customers.</p>  
    <h3>Concept development or concept testing</h3>  
    <p> In this stage, the product idea evolves into a product concept: something that a company can present to target audiences for gauging customer feedback. This presentation can take the form of a detailed description or a prototype that demonstrates the feasibility of the product vision but with more limited functionality.</p>  
    <h3> Marketing strategy</h3>   
    <p> Marketing is often associated with product messaging, social media and marketing campaigns geared toward target markets. But a marketing strategy could also include sales and market share goals and product pricing and distribution strategy, among other facets</p>  
    <h3> Business analysis</h3>   
    <p> Will the product under development be good for business? This is determined during the business analysis stage, where teams calculate projections for sales, costs and profits.</p>   
    <h3>Test marketing</h3>  
    <p>Companies may choose to roll out the product in a limited fashion in specific markets before engaging in a wider product launch. In traditional test marketing, sales results are compared among multiple cities for a duration of six months to a year. What product development teams learn from user feedback during test marketing can lead to adjustments in marketing strategy</p>   
    <h3>Commercialization</h3>   
    <p>The commercialization stage entails the mass production of the product and the introduction of the final product to the general market—in other words, the official, scaled product launch.</p>
