    <h2>Corrective Maintenance</h2>
    <p>
        Under corrective maintenance, maintenance teams get to work as soon as a problem occurs. The goal of corrective maintenance is to bring systems back to regular operation as quickly as possible. With corrective maintenance, there is no program for regular maintenance. A problem must be present before maintenance occurs.
    </p>
    <h2>Example</h2>
    <p>
        Repairing a broken HVAC unit rather than maintaining it. <br>
        Repairing an HVAC unit after data from the unit shows it is not functioning at peak performance.
