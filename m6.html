    <h2>Reactive (Run-to-Failure) Maintenance</h2>
    <p>
        Reactive maintenance is a maintenance system that responds when a failure of machinery or systems occurs. The repairs may be handled in-house or by the manufacturer, or through a combination of in-house maintenance and the manufactureâ€™s technicians. Unlike preventive maintenance, reaction maintenance occurs when a breakdown happens.
    </p>
    <h2>Example</h2>
    <p>
        The car wash at the local gas station breaks, and the maintenance team is notified. The printing press that handles varnish applications fails, and maintenance or the factory service team is notified, and repairs are scheduled.
