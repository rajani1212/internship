    <h2>Condition-Based Maintenance</h2>
    <p>
        As the name implies, condition-based maintenance focuses on outcomes through measurement or observation. Machines have a range of normal operating conditions. Within that range, the operation is acceptable. Near the edges of that range, maintenance may be required.
    </p>
    <h2>Example</h2>
    <p>
        An excellent example of condition-based maintenance is that pesky check engine light in your car. When the check engine light comes on, the carâ€™s system has indicated that something is out of the normal range and maintenance needs to be scheduled. The exact process may occur with machines that self-monitor through smart technology or physical inspections in a business.

    <p>
        Another example of condition-based maintenance might be when a machine begins to use more energy to function. That may be that a tank of fuel does not last as long or that there is a sudden spike in electrical usage. Again, that level of condition requires maintenance.
