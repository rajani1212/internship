    <h1>Platform engineering goals</h1>
        <p>
            Today, platform engineers implement toolchains and workflows as integrated software development platforms. To create effective platforms, platform engineering teams should keep in mind a number of goals:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Developer productivity. A platform should support and enhance developer productivity. A meaningful platform doesn't just alleviate platform tasks from developers -- it actually enhances and accelerates development efforts.
            </li>
            <li>
                Self-service. A platform should be a frictionless resource. Developers should be free to use the tools and services needed with little (if any) intervention from the platform engineering team.
            </li>
            <li>
                Security. A platform must be secure -- not only in access to users, but also to protect the intellectual property reflected in the codebase as well as constituent data.
            </li>
            <li>
                Resilience. Developers cannot work without a platform, so platforms must provide both scalability and availability to meet the uptime and performance needs of developers.
            </li>
            <li>
                Observability. Platforms require monitoring to ensure performance and availability, so tools are typically fitted with instrumentation for health and performance monitoring. When a tool fails or crashes, platform engineers must act quickly to remediate the issue and prevent extended disruptions.
            </li>
            <li>
                Collaboration. Multiple teams, which can number dozens or even hundreds of people, might use the platform. This makes collaboration tools and capabilities a vital part of any platform. Capabilities might include collaborative repositories, interactive editing and testing tools, and other creative means of sharing ideas, work and results.
            </li>
            <li>
                Improvement. Platform development should enable developer success. Improvement can include regular troubleshooting and support, along with periodic updates and enhancements to tools, APIs, data stores, workflows and policies.
            </li>
        </ul>
