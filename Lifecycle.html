    <h1 style="font-weight: bold;text-align: center;font-family: century;color: blue;">Product Life Cycle</h1>
    <p>A product life cycle is the length of time from a product first being introduced to consumers until it is removed from the market.This concept is used by management and by marketing professionals as a factor in deciding when it is appropriate to increase advertising, reduce prices, expand to new markets, or redesign packaging. The process of strategizing ways to continuously support and maintain a product is called product life cycle management. </p>

    <ul><li><p style="font-size:20px;line-height: 20px;">A product's life cycle is usually broken down into four stages.<ul><li><p style="font-size:20px;line-height: 20px;">Introduction</p></li><li><p style="font-size:20px;line-height: 20px;">Growth</p></li><li><p style="font-size:20px;line-height: 20px;">Maturity</p></li><li><p style="font-size:20px;line-height: 20px;">Decline</p></li></ul></p></li></ul>
    
    
            <h2 style="font-weight:bold;color:blue">1. Introduction Stage</h2>
            <p>The introduction phase of the traditional product life cycle begins with the actual launch of a product. The effort involved in researching, designing, and building the product is not tackled here. Introducing a product is a highly specialized, expensive affair and typically no one talks about profit. Instead, the focus is on advertising, sales, and distribution.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Occurs when product first enters marketplace
                   </li>
                   <li>Promoting consumer awareness</li>
                   <li> 
                    Getting customers to try new product</li>
                    <li> 
                        Millions of dollars spent to educate consumers</li>
                    <li> Major task: getting product in the marketplace</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2 style="font-weight:bold;color:blue">2. Growth Stage</h2> 
            <p>Once a product has been successfully introduced into the market and has survived, it reaches the growth phase. This is good news because it means that people want the product and are willing to pay for it! It also means you'll need to ramp up your marketing efforts.</p>

             <p>   The focus in the growth phase is on rapidly gaining new customers and increasing market share as quickly as possible. Existing users might promote your product by using it or talking about it, which is great because word-of-mouth is the best possible promotion strategy.</p>
                
            <p>  The primary challenge in this stage is to orchestrate the marketing strategy, prices, new features, and increase capacity and distribution so that there are no hiccups to acquiring new customers. However, being too cautious means that competitors can grab market share.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>More competitors enter the marketplace
                </li>
                <li>Adding distribution outlets </li>
                <li>Product improves:
                    <ul><li>adding flavors, features, etc.</li></ul> 
               </li>
               <li>Improved to stay competitive
            </li>
            <li>Sold in more locations
            </li>
            </ul>
        <h2 style="font-weight:bold;color:blue">3. Maturity Stage</h2> 
        <p>The beginning of the maturity phase of the product life cycle is marked by a reduction in the rate of growth. At this stage of the life cycle, sales grow very slowly or reach a plateau. The maturity stage is typically the longest phase for most successful products, and many of the products that you currently use are most likely to be in the maturity phase.</p>

         <p>   In the maturity phase, the product marketing strategy is focused on differentiation from competing products. Typically, a product manager reduces prices to ensure maximum sales and competitiveness. A market-leading product may experience maximum profitability at this stage while #2 or #3 products typically experience reductions in profit due to price reduction and competition.</p>

            <li>Attracting new buyers is a challenge
            </li>
            <li>Product has reached its peak
            </li>
         </ul>
         <h2 style="font-weight:bold;color:blue">4. Decline Stage</h2>
         <p>All products inevitably reach the decline phase of the product life cycle. A market-leading product may last longer than others, but it too will reach market decline. There are multiple reasons for a declining product .</p>
