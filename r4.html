    <h1>Validating Requirements</h1>
    <p>Validation is like double-checking to make sure that the requirements are correct and will lead to the desired product. This phase involves reviewing the documented requirements with stakeholders to ensure they accurately represent what is needed. Techniques like reviews, walkthroughs, and prototypes are used to validate the requirements.
