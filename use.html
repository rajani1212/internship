            </h2>
            <p>
                Let us take two products as examples for understanding it’s ideation and conceptualization.
            </p>
            <h2>Product 1 – <font color="green">Google Assistant</font>
            </h2>
            <p>
                Google Assistant’s arrival in 2016 stemmed from a desire to improve upon existing virtual assistants and address their limitations.
            </p>
            <h2>
                <font color="red">Drawbacks of previous Assistants:</font>
            </h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Limited Understanding: Early assistants often misinterpreted commands or struggled with complex requests. For example, an assistant might not understand the difference between “play music” and “play my playlist”.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Reliance of Keywords: Users had to remember specific phrases or keywords to trigger actions. This made interactions less intuitive and natural.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Lack of Context: Without context, assistants might provide irrelevant response. For example, if a user asked for “directions to work” it wouldn’t consider your current location or preferred mode of transportation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Limited Integration: Early assistants often functioned in silos, unable to access information from other apps or services.

                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                By addressing these limitations, Google Assistant aimed to create a more user-friendly and versatile experience. It focused on understanding natural language, learning user context, and leveraging the power of Google’s vast data and ecosystem.

            <h2>Reasons for Google Assistant:
            </h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Focus on Natural Language Understanding (NLU): Previous assistants often required specific keywords or phrases commands to function. Google Assistant aimed to understand natural language, allowing users to speak in a more conversational way.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Contextual Awareness: Early assistants struggled to understand the context of a conversation. Google Assistant was designed to learn from past interactions and preferences, personalizing responses and offering more relevant suggestions.

                </li>
                <li>
                    Integration with Google Services: Many assistants lacked deep integration with other platforms. Google Assistant aimed to leverage Google’s suite of services like Search, Maps, and Calendar providing a more unified user experience.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Mobile-first Approach: As smartphones became ubiquitous, Google Assistant prioritized working seamlessly on mobile devices, making it readily available on the go.

            <h2>Product 2 – <font color="green">Google Pay</font>
            </h2>
            <p>
                The idea behind Google Pay (Formerly Android Pay) to address the limitations of traditional payment methods and existing mobiles wallets.
            </p>
            <h2>
                <font color="red">Drawbacks of Previous Payment Methods:</font>
            </h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Physical Cards: Carrying and managing multiple cards can be cumbersome and there’s a risk of theft or loss.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Limited Mobile Wallets (Like carrier-specific solutions): These wallets might have restricted functionality, limited compatibility with stores, or lack integration with other services.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Security Concerns: Swiping physical cards or using outdated mobile wallets might expose users to fraud if security features are weak.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Friction at checkout: Entering PINs or manually launching separate wallet apps could slow down the checkout process.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Improved Convenience: Google Pay streamlines the in-store checkout process. Users can make contactless payment with their smartphones eliminating the need to carry physical cards.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Enhanced Security: Google Pay prioritizes security by tokenization. Instead of sharing actual card details with merchants, a unique virtual account number is used for each transaction.

                <li>
                    Wider Compatibility: With Google Pay, Users don’t need specific NFC-enabled phones. It leverages Host card emulation (HCE) technology, allowing payments on many existing android smartphones.
