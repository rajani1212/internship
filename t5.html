    <h2>Regression Testing</h2>
    <p>Regression testing ensures that existing functionalities of a software application continue to work as expected after code changes or updates are introduced. It's like a safety net to catch any unintended consequences of modifications.</p>
    <p> Here's the typical process:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A set of test cases are created to cover core functionalities of the software.</li>
        <li>These test cases are re-run after any code changes are made.</li>
        <li>The purpose is to identify any regressions, which are situations where existing functionalities break due to the new code.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Example:</h3>
    <p>Imagine an e-commerce website is adding a new feature for social media login. Regression testing would involve re-running existing test cases for functionalities like product search, shopping cart, and checkout process. This ensures that these core functionalities are not impacted by the introduction of the new social login feature.</p>
    <p> By employing these testing methodologies throughout the development lifecycle, you can ensure a high-quality product that meets user needs, functions flawlessly, and delivers a positive user experience. Remember, testing is an ongoing process, and it's wise to incorporate these methods throughout the development cycle, not just at the very end. </p>
