    <h2>Product deployment</h2>
    <p>
        Product deployment is the process of delivering a product to its end-users or customers. It involves various stages and activities that ensure the product is correctly installed, configured, and made available for use in a specific environment. The deployment process can vary depending on the type of product (software, hardware, etc.) and the complexity of its implementation.
