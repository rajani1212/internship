    <h2>User Testing</h2>
    <p>User testing is all about observing real users interact with a product or service. It's like watching how people navigate your app or website to understand their behavior and identify areas for improvement. 
    </p>
    <p>Here's how it's done:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Users are recruited who represent the target audience for the product.</li>
        <li>They are given tasks to complete while using the product or service. </li>
        <li>Researchers observe their actions, facial expressions, and any verbal feedback they provide.</li>
        <li>This observation helps identify usability issues, understand user flow, and pinpoint areas where users might get confused or frustrated.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Example:</h3>
    <p>A new mobile banking app is being developed. User testing is conducted by observing users as they try to transfer money, pay bills, and check their account balance. The researchers might notice that users struggle to find the money transfer option or that the bill payment process is too complex. This valuable feedback helps the developers simplify the app's interface and improve the overall user experience.</p>
