    <h2>Predictive Maintenance</h2>
    <p>
        One of the more advanced ways to conduct maintenance tasks, predictive maintenance, is data-driven. Data supplied by the equipment indicates when maintenance is needed. Data also is a means to map when the failure of the machine may occur.
    </p>
    <h2>Example</h2>
    <p>
        Technology is all around us, and many businesses put it to work for them. The examples of predictive maintenance include:    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Alarms that sound when the temperature on a machine or in an environment begins to move outside the safe parameters set up per the manufacturer’s guidelines. The internal temperature in a data center’s server room becomes too hot, and sensors in that room send out at alert.</li>
            <li>A sensor in an engine monitors misfires and alerts maintenance that engine service is needed.</li>
            <li>
                A sensor on a refrigeration truck monitors the internal temperatures of the truck and alerts the driver when the internal temperature falls outside acceptable parameters.
            </li>
            <li>
                These alerts do not necessarily mean a complete failure occurs, but that condition is approaching a range where catastrophic failure can occur.
            </li>
        </ul>
