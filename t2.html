    <h2>A/B Testing (Split Testing):</h2>
    <p>A/B testing is a data-driven approach to compare two versions of a product element and see which one performs better with users. It's like running a controlled experiment to determine the most effective design or feature.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A website or app interface element (e.g., call-to-action button, product page layout) is modified to create two variations (Version A and Version B).</li>
        <li>Users are randomly divided into groups, and each group is shown one of the variations.</li>
        <li>User engagement metrics like clicks, conversions, or time spent on a page are tracked for both versions.</li>
        <li>Based on the data, the version that performs better in terms of user engagement is chosen for implementation.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Example: </h3>
    <p>An e-commerce website wants to increase sign-ups for their newsletter. They create two versions of their signup form:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Version A: Simple form with email address field and a signup button.</li>
        <li>Version B: Same form with an additional checkbox for receiving promotional offers.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Through A/B testing, they can see which version yields a higher signup rate, helping them optimize their signup process. 
    </p>
