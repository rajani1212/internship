    <h2>What QA Testing ?</h2>
    <P>Concept testing is defined as a research method that involves asking customers questions about your concepts and ideas for a product or service before actually launching it. Thus, you can gauge your customersâ€™ acceptance and their willingness to buy and therefore make critical decisions before the launch. </P>
    <p>QA testing is the umbrella term for a wide range of activities that ensure a software application meets specific quality standards. It's like a thorough examination to identify any bugs, defects, or usability issues that might hinder a smooth user experience. Here are some common QA testing techniques:
        <ul>
            <li>Functional Testing: This verifies if the software functions as intended according to its requirements. It involves testing each feature and ensuring it delivers the promised functionality.</li>
            <li>Non-Functional Testing:This goes beyond the 'what' and focuses on 'how' the software performs. It evaluates usability, performance (speed, stability), security, and compatibility across different devices and browsers.</li>
            <li>Regression Testing: This ensures existing functionalities remain intact after code changes or updates are introduced.</li>
            <li>Usability Testing:This involves observing real users interact with the software to assess its ease of use and identify any pain points.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3> Example: </h3>
        <p>Let's say we're developing a new music streaming app. QA testing would involve:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Functional Testing:Checking if users can search for songs, create playlists, adjust volume, and play music without interruptions.</li>
            <li>Non-Functional Testing:Evaluating how fast the app loads songs, how well it performs on different devices (phones, tablets), and ensuring the login process is secure. </li>
            <li>Usability Testing:Observing users navigate the app's interface, checking if they can easily find desired features, and identifying any confusing elements.</li>
        </ul>
       
    <h2>Benifits</h2>
    <p>Using concept testing, you can also get in-depth insights into different aspects of your idea. You can ask questions about a specific feature, look and feel, pricing, and more. Thus you can assure the validity of every detail before launching the product.

        Organizations and businesses use surveys to carry out concept testing making it a simple proposition for brands of all sizes to utilize.</p>
